    "2. block_user(self, user, other_user): This function would allow a user to block another user, preventing them from appearing in the user's matches list or receiving messages from the user. It could take two arguments: user and other_user, which are User objects representing the user who is blocking and the user who is being blocked, respectively.\n",

It could take two arguments: user and other_user, which are User objects representing the user who is reporting the abuse and the user who is being reported, respectively.\n",
    "4. set_location(self, user, location): This function would allow a user to update their location, which could be used to match them with other users who are nearby. It could take two arguments: user, which is a User object representing the user who is updating their location, and location, which is a string containing the user's new location."
